I have always been interested in understanding how good college football teams truly are, based on data rather than just human opinion like the AP poll is based on. This is my first attempt at a college football ranking system. The algorithm I used is (winpercentage * 100) + (strength of schedule * 2) + (offensive ppg - defensive ppg). Win percentage is too important in this method and the weight of strength of schedule and ppg differential is kind of random. The resultant team rankings after week 7 of the 2024 college football season can be found in results.txt.
